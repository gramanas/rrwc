* rrwc
resize-rename-watermark-comment
is a utility for photographers that does exactly what it says on the package.

It takes a (possibly huge) amount of photographs, and it spits them on different
locations, each with it's own rrwc options.

It's currently under developement.

* Goals
  - Cross Platform (linux + windows)
  - Fast
  - Multithreading
  - cli

* Dependencies
  - [[https://www.qt.io/][Qt5]] for the Gui
  - Qt5 for the data
  - [[http://www.exiv2.org/][Exiv2]] for exif management
  - [[https://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] for the image processing

You also need the [[https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/][Hdf5]] library.

On ubuntu:
#+BEGIN_SRC
sudo apt-get install libopencv2-dev qt5base-dev libhdf5-dev libexiv2-dev qtcreator
#+END_SRC


* Test - contribute - notes

Anyone is welcome to contribute whatever they want.
I don't yet know how to create a full scale cross platform application
so this currently only works on linux. The libraries are cross platform though,
so when I have a working prototype I'll look on the windows side of things.

Apple users... don't know!

I've only tested it on Arch linux, but the process is as follows:
- clone the repo
- ~cd /path/to/repo~
- ~cmake .~
- ~make~
- ~./rrwc~

Make sure to use CMake >= 3.9.4
