* rrwc
resize-rename-watermark-comment
is a utility for photographers that does exactly what it says on the package.

It takes a (possibly huge) amount of photographs, and it spits them on different
locations, each with it's own rrwc options.

It's currently under developement.

* Goals
  - Cross Platform
  - Lightning Fast
  - Multithreading
  - Ability to work with smb/sshfs 
  - cli

* Libraries
  - [[https://www.qt.io/][Qt5]] for the Gui
  - Qt5 for the data
  - [[https://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] for the rrwc
