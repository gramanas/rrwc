* rrwc
resize-rename-watermark-comment
is a utility for photographers that does exactly what it says on the package.

It takes a (possibly huge) amount of photographs, and it spits them on different
locations, each with it's own rrwc options.

It's currently under developement.

* Goals
  - Cross Platform (linux + windows)
  - Lightning Fast
  - Multithreading
  - Ability to work with smb/sshfs 
  - cli

* Libraries
  - [[https://www.qt.io/][Qt5]] for the Gui
  - Qt5 for the data
  - [[https://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] for the rrwc

* Test - contribute - notes

Anyone is welcome to contribute every way the can.
I don't yet know how to create a full scale cross platform application
so this currently only works on linux. The libraries are cross platform though,
so when I have a working prototype I'll look on the windows side of things.

Apple users, I don't care and I never will. Go buy photoshop or something.

I've only tested it on Arch linux, but the process is as follows:
- clone the repo
- cd /path/to/repo
- cmake .
- make
- ./rrwc

Obviously you need to have QT5 and OpenCV installed correctly so
cmake can find them. 

I only tested it with CMake 3.9.4
