* rrwc
resize-rename-watermark-comment
is a utility for photographers that does exactly what it says on the package.

It takes a (possibly huge) amount of photographs, and it spits them on different
locations, each with it's own rrwc options.

It's currently under developement.

* Goals
  - Cross Platform (linux + windows)
  - Lightning Fast
  - Multithreading
  - Ability to work with smb/sshfs 
  - cli

* Dependencies
  - [[https://www.qt.io/][Qt5]] for the Gui
  - Qt5 for the data
  - [[https://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] for the rest

You also need [[https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/][Hdf5]] for reasons I have yet to discover. (Maybe an OpenCV dependency)

* Test - contribute - notes

Anyone is welcome to contribute whatever they want.
I don't yet know how to create a full scale cross platform application
so this currently only works on linux. The libraries are cross platform though,
so when I have a working prototype I'll look on the windows side of things.

Apple users... don't know, don't care.

I've only tested it on Arch linux, but the process is as follows:
- clone the repo
- ~cd /path/to/repo~
- ~cmake .~
- ~make~
- ~./rrwc~

Obviously you need to have QT5 and OpenCV installed correctly so
cmake can find them. Don't forget to also install Hdf5 so you won't get
compiler errors.

Make sure to use CMake >= 3.9.4
